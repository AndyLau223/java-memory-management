# Metaspace 

The metaspace is a special area of native memory area outside of the heap. Native memory is memory 
provided by the operating system to an application for its own use. The JVM uses the metaspace 
to store class-related information, that is the class runtime representations(class metadata).


## Metadata 

Metadata is information about data. Like, columns in database are metadata about the data in the column. Thus, 
if a column name is **Name**, and the specific row's value is **John**, then **Name** is metadata about **John**.

In java, class metadata consists the following:

* Class files
* Structure and methods of the class
* Constants
* Annotations
* Optimizations
